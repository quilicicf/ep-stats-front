# EP stats front

> A front-end for Empires and puzzles stats, gathered with [ep-stats](https://github.com/quilicicf/ep-stats).

## Disclaimer

I am not linked to small giant games (game developer) in any way.

This project is experimental and developed for the fun, on my free time.

I did it fully in ELM to learn the language and polish my CSS skills. This serves as a learning tool first.

## What it does

As a serious E&P player, I wanted to get insights into how my alliance - and its members - fares in wars and against titans.

The only summary the games gives you is a message in the alliance chat.

This project fetches the statistics retrieved by [ep-stats](https://github.com/quilicicf/ep-stats) and pushed to a Google spreadsheet and presents them nicely.

You can either use [ep-stats](https://github.com/quilicicf/ep-stats) to read the screenshots and upload the stats to the spreadsheet or maintain them by hand.

The expected structure of the sheet is detailed on the [demo spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10y4Y1UDsxU05lxI8KTaq1QVxtWtbYm5Kh7kMjbjNtAM/edit#gid=1902473722).

## Where and how can I try it?

It is hosted on a free-tier account on [Netlify](https://netlify.com).

You can try it at: [ep-stats.netlify.com](https://ep-stats.netlify.app).

Use the key to the [demo spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10y4Y1UDsxU05lxI8KTaq1QVxtWtbYm5Kh7kMjbjNtAM/edit#gid=1902473722): `START_KEY|>‍﻿⁠⁠‌​‌﻿​‌‌​‌​‌‌‍⁠​‍⁠‌​‌‌‍⁠‌‌​⁠‌​‍﻿‌⁠‌​​‌‍‌‌﻿‌‌‍‌‌⁠⁠​﻿​​﻿‌‍‍‌﻿‍‌‌​‌⁠﻿⁠‌​‍﻿‍⁠‌​‌⁠﻿‌‌⁠‌‌​‌‌​‌﻿​​‌⁠‌​﻿⁠‌​‍﻿‌⁠‌​‍‌﻿‍‌⁠‍​​‍‍‍​﻿﻿‍‌﻿​﻿​​​⁠‌⁠﻿‌﻿﻿​﻿​‍‌⁠‍‍⁠‌‍‍‌﻿﻿​‌⁠‍⁠‌​‍​​⁠﻿‌​‌‌⁠‍‍‌﻿​⁠‌​﻿‌‌﻿﻿‌﻿​​﻿‍‌﻿​‌​‍​﻿﻿‌‍⁠‍‍⁠​‍​‌‌⁠‍⁠​‌‍‌​‍‍‌‍​‌​‍‌‍​​‍⁠‌﻿​​​​​‍‍⁠‌​‍﻿‍⁠‌​‌‌﻿‌⁠﻿​​​‌​﻿‌‍⁠‌‌﻿‌‍﻿⁠‌​‍﻿‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‍‍‌⁠﻿‌‌​‍﻿﻿<|END_KEY`

## Roadmap

There's none per-se but I create issues for everything that comes to mind.
